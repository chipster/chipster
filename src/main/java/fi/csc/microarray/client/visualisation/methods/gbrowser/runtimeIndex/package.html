	<p>The data layer implementation for non-indexed data sources. Data
		layers receive DataRequest objects and sends DataResult objects.</p>

	<p>The Conversion classes convert raw file rows to high level
		objects that are easy and efficient to handle in the view layer. When
		only some kind of summary of the data is needed in the view layer,
		that summary should be calculated in the conversion class to avoid
		choking view layer thread.</p>

	<p>The data requests are made in genomic coordinates, but it is not
		obvious how to find the corresponding rows from the file. The
		conversion classes rely on the Index interface to locate those rows.</p>

	<p>There are two implementations of Index interface: InMemoryIndex
		and BinarySearchIndex. The InMemoryIndex keeps the whole file in
		memory. The BinarySearchIndex requires a sorted data file. The
		requested location is searched with binary search algorithm. These
		index implementations can be used with different file formats. The
		presentation of the genomic coordinates differs between the file
		formats and therefore the Index implementations rely on the format
		specific LineParser implementations to parse the genomic coordinates.</p>

	<p>The view layer needs a list of the available chromosomes to make
		the requests. This list can be constructed with the class
		ChromosomeBinarySearch.</p>

	<p>The classes BinarySearchIndex and ChromosomeBinarySearch require
		an efficient random access read capability. Unfortunately Java offers
		efficient random access only to local files, but not over http. A
		simple buffered random access reading is implemented in class
		RandomAccessLineReader. The same implementation is used also with the
		local files (instead of Java's implementation), because the
		performance is well-matched and it makes testing simpler.</p>
