<p>The Chipster Genome browser. Basic architecture of the browser code is 3 layered: view layer, processing layer and data source layer.
View layer is run inside the Swing event dispatch thread. The other two lower layers are run inside several threads, each 
corresponding to a data source.</p>

<p>View layer sends AreaRequest objects and receives AreaResult objects. Processing layer receives AreaRequest and file result objects and
sends file requests. Data source layer receives file request and sends file results.</p>

<p>The major classes/interfaces of the view layer are GenomePlot (the core, constructed out of views), View (does actual drawing), 
Drawable (tells what is drawn) and Track (generates Drawable objects).</p>

<p>The processing layer has two different implementations: one for non-indexed (chunk) data sources and 
other for indexed (SAM) data sources. The central classes of the non-indexed case are ChunkTreeHandlerThread and TreeNode.
The central classes for the indexed case are SAMHandlerThread and ConcisedValueCache.</p>

<p>The data source layer has two implementations, like the processing layer. For non-indexed data sources 
the major class is ChunkFileFetcherThread and for indexed data sources it is SAMFileFetcherThread.</p>

<p>Important generic classes are the ones that we use to represent genomic coordinates: BpCoord (single coordinate), 
BpCoordRegion (region defined by start and end coordinates) and Chromosome (normalised name of the chromosome).</p>
