<p>The Chipster Genome browser. Basic architecture of the browser code is 2 layered: view layer and data layer.
View layer is run inside the Swing event dispatch thread. The data layer is run inside several threads, each 
corresponding to a data source.</p>

<p>View layer sends DataRequest objects and receives DataResult objects.</p>

<p>The major classes/interfaces of the view layer are GBrowserPlot (the core, constructed out of views), View (does actual drawing), 
Drawable (tells what is drawn) and Track (generates Drawable objects).</p>

<p>The data layer has two different implementations: one for non-indexed (package runtimeIndex) data sources and 
other for indexed (package fileIndex) data sources. The central class of the non-indexed case is BinarySearchIndex.
The central classes for the indexed case are BamTo*Conversion, IndexedFastaConversion and ConcisedValueCache.</p>

<p>Important generic classes are the ones that we use to represent genomic coordinates: BpCoord (single coordinate), 
Region (region defined by start and end coordinates) and Chromosome (normalised name of the chromosome).</p>
