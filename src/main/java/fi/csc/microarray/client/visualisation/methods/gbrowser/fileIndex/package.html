<p>The data layer implementation for indexed data sources. Data layers receive DataRequest objects and sends DataResult objects.</p>

<p>The indexed data sources have a precalculated index file.
The central classes for the indexed case are BamTo*Conversion, IndexedFastaConversion and ConcisedValueCache. All 
the current implementations are based on Picard library, which actually reads the index file and calculates the 
right part of the actual data file. The classes in this package mostly just present a Chipster style interface on top of
the Picard.</p>
