<h2>Importing normalized data</h2>

<p>You can import normalized data into Chipster, as long as it is tab delimited and preferably log-transformed. 
If your data is not log-transformed, you can transform it in Chipster using the tool "Change interpretation". 
In the <a href="normalizedExample.tsv">normalized data file</a> every column must have a name, and the names of the expression value columns must start with text "chip.". 
Only one title row is allowed. The first column must contain probeset/gene names, and the name of this column must be "identifier". 
You also need a <a href="phenodataExample.tsv">phenodata file</a> describing your experiment.
The easiest way to convert your normalized data to Chipster format and create a phenodata file for it is to run the
tool "Normalisation / Process prenormalized". 
In order to run this tool, you have to import your normalized data to Chipster using the Import tool.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can modify your data manually to Chipster format, import it directly to Chipster once its filename extension is .tsv, and
generate phenodata for it using the the tool "Utilitites/ Generate phenodata". If you have already generated a phenodata file in some other 
program and it contains the right columns for Chipster, you can import it directly and link it to the normalized file by right-clicking on 
the normalized file and selecting "Link to phenodata"</p>.
