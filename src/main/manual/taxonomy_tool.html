<h2>Get taxonomy information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Print out taxonomy information based of taxonomy names or ID numbers.
</p>


<p>This tool uses EMBOSS commands <b>taxget</b>, <b>taxgetdown</b>, <b>taxgetdown</b>, and <b>taxgetspecies</b> to retrieve taxonomy information.
The Taxon to be studied is defined using scientific name (e.g. mus musculus), taxonomy id number (e.g 10090). I some cases a common English name can be used too (e.q. mouse).

There are four different taxonomy information sets that can be retrieved:
 <ul>
 <li><b>Get taxon</b> shows the basic information of the given taxon. For example for mouse, the tool by 
 default creates a table containing the taxonomic ID number of the taxon and its parent taxon, level of the taxon in the taxonomic system and the scientific name of the taxon. </li>
 <li><b>Get parents of the taxon</b> shows all the taxonomic levels from the root of the taxonomic tree to the given taxonomy item.</li>
 <li><b>Get descendants of the taxon</b> shows all the descendant taxons of the give taxon</li>
 <li><b>Get all species under taxon</b> collects all the taxonomic species under the given taxon. For example for subfamily <i>Murinae</i> (ID: 10066)
 this selection produces a table containing the taxonomic information of the 618 species belonging to the subfamily. </li>
 </ul>
 
 By default, this tool produces a table formatted file, but the results can also be produced in EBI, NCBI or TAX formatted text files, that contain 
 more information than the table format.
