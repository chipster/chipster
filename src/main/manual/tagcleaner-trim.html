<h2>Utilities / Trim primers/adaptors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Trim tags from sequences.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Input type (FASTQ, FASTA) [FASTQ]</li>
<li>Tag sequence at 3'-end (String) [-]</li>
<li>Maximum  mismatches at the 3'-end (Integer) [0]</li>
<li>Tag sequence at 5'-end (String) [-]</li>
<li>Maximum  mismatches at the 5'-end (Integer) [0]</li>
<li>Trim within (Integer) [0]</li>
<li>Split fragment-to-fragment concatenations (yes, no) [yes]</li>
<li>Allowed mismatches (Integer) [0]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The sequence of the tag (i.e. primer/adapter) could occur not only at the sequence end, but also at any other position of the 
sequence. To assure that only tags are trimmed, the tag sequences can be defined to occur only at the 
ends allowing a certain number of variable bases with the "Trim within" parameter. If specified, the 
value has to be at least the number of bases in the tag sequence. A typical value would be about 1.5x 
the tag length. 0 value means the option is ignored.
</p>
<p>
When "Split fragment-to-fragment concatenations" option is selected, the tool removes tag contaminations 
inside the sequences and splits fragment-to-fragment concatenations into separate sequences. The "Allowed 
mismatches" value specifies the maximum number of allowed mismatches for the internal (concatenated) tag 
sequence(s). This feature should be used with caution for inputs with only a 5' or 3' tag sequence (likely 
splits too many false positive that naturally occur for single tags compared to much longer concatenated 
5' and 3' tags). This option will cause a decrease in speed.
</p>
<p>
Input can be a FASTQ file or a FASTA file. If using a FASTA file you can provide an optional QUAL file to trim sequences and their quality scores.
