<h2> Create a consensus sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool uses EMBOSS program <b>cons</b> or <b>consambig</b> to 
create a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence alignment.


To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
matrix are used to calculate a score for each amino acid residue or
nucleotide at each position in the alignment. The highest scoring
residue goes into the consensus sequence if the score is higher than a
user-specified "plurality" value, otherwise, there is no consensus at
   that position.

If <i>ambiguous consensus sequence</i> is selected, this tool determines which
 ambiguity codes match all residues or nucleotides in the input sequences at each position.



<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/AlignmentFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence alignment formats</a>.
Note that this tool reads just one input file, that should contain all the sequences to be analyzed.
</p>
<p>
For more details, please check the manual pages of <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/cons.html">cons</a> and <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/consambig.html">consambig</a> commands.

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Output is a fasta formatted sequence file.
