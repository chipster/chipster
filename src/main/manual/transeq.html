<h2>Translate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool translate nucleic acid sequences into protein sequences.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<li><b>Frame(s) to translate</b> </li>
<li><b>Genetic code to use</b> </li>
<li><b>Regions to translate</b> (eg: 4-57,78-94) Regions to translate. A set of regions is specified by a set of pairs of positions. They are separated by any non-digit, non-alpha character. Examples of region specifications are: 24-45, 56-78 1:45, 67=99;765..888  1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99 Note: you should not try to use this option with any other frame than the default, -frame=1. </li>
<li><b>Trim trailing X's and *'s</b>b This removes all 'X' and '*' characters from the right end of the translation. The trimming process starts at the end and continues until the next character is not a 'X' or a '*' </li>
<li><b>Change all *'s to X's</b> This changes all STOP codon positions from the '*' character to 'X' (an unknown residue\). This is useful because some programs will not accept protein sequences with '*' characters in them.</li>
<li><b>Define frame '-1' as starting in the last codon</b> The default definition of frame '-1' is the reverse-complement of the set of codons used in frame 1. (Frame -2 is the set of codons used by frame 2, similarly frames -3 and 3). This is a common standard, used by the Staden package and other programs. If you prefer to define frame '-1' as using the set of codons starting with the last codon of the sequence, then set this to be true.)</li>


<li><b>Output sequence format</b> </li>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
This tools runs EMBOSS command <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.3/emboss/apps/transeq.html">transeq</a> to translate the given nucleotide sequence into protein.
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Output is a fasta formatted protein sequence file.
