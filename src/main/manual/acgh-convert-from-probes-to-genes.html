	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Detect genes from called copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Using the chromosomal locations of the data points in copy number data set, convert the data from probe/bin-based to gene-based. The probes/bins from which the copy number call for a given gene are determined as follows. If there are probes/bins overlapping with the position of the gene, they are used. In case of no overlaps, the last preceding and first tailing probe/bin are used.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Method to use to determine calls for the genes (majority, unambiguous) [majority]</li>
		<li>Method to use for other data columns (mean, median) [mean]</li>
		<li>Human genome build to use (GRCh37/hg19, NCBI36/hg18, NCBI35/hg17, NCBI34/hg16) [GRCh37/hg19]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>The list of Ensembl genes is retrieved, and the input data converted from probe/bin-based to gene-based. For a given gene, the probes/bins to use are determined as described in the referenced CanGEM paper. The majority method means that the gene is marked as a loss (or gain), if more than 50% of the determined probes/bins show a loss (or a gain). The unambiguous method requires that all of the probes/bins have to give the same signal, or otherwise the gene is marked as normal copy number.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>Input data set transferred from probe/bin-based to gene-based measurements.</p>
