<h2>Phylogenies from distance matrix by N-J or UPGMA method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool is based on EMBOSS command <b>fneighbor</b> that is a wrapper command for 
command <b>neighbor</b> of the <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">PHYLIP</a> package.
</p>
<p>
<b>Phylogenies from distance matrix by N-J or UPGMA method</b> is an implementation by Mary Kuhner and 
John Yamato of Saitou and Nei's "Neighbor Joining Method," 
and of the UPGMA (Average Linkage clustering) method. Neighbor Joining is a distance matrix method producing an 
unrooted tree without the assumption of a clock. UPGMA does assume a clock. 
The branch lengths are not optimized by the least squares criterion but the methods are very 
fast and thus can handle much larger data sets. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
<li>Type of data matrix (fneighbor parameter -matrixtype )</li>
<li>Neighbor-joining or UPGMA tree (fneighbor parameter -treetype )</li>
<li>Species number to use as outgroup (fneighbor parameter -outgrno )</li>
<li>Randomise input order of species (fneighbor parameter -jumble )</li>
<li>Random number seed between 1 and 32767 (must be odd\) (fneighbor parameter -seed )</li>
<li>Subreplicates (fneighbor parameter -replicates)</li>
<li>Write out trees to tree file (fneighbor parameter -trout )</li>
<li>Print data at start of run (fneighbor parameter -printdata )</li>
<li>Print out tree (fneighbor parameter -treeprint )</li>
<li>Collect a log file </li>

<h3>Input and output</h3>

<p>
Input is a phylip formatted distance matrix file.
</p>
<p>
Output consists of two files containing. One containing a human readable output report (neighbor.txt )
and a treefile (treefile.txt) that can be used as an input for tree drawing tools (Plot an unrooted tree, Plot cladogram).
