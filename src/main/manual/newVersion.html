      <li>Analysis sessions are automatically saved on the background, so if your session stops unexpectedly, you can always retrieve your data from the server.
      <li>Analysis sessions use a new format so that saved sessions are functional even if the analysis tools that were used for creating them have changed meanwhile. The new
      sessions have ending .zip. <b>The old sessions (.cs) won't work in Chipster 2.0</b>, but we will keep the Chipster version 1.4.7 running so that people can access also their old sessions.
      Note that Chipster 2.0 RC was the release candidate version of Chipster 2.0, so those sessions are compatible. 
      <b>We strongly encourage all users to move to Chipster 2.0 now, and use Chipster 1.4.7 only when working with old .cs sessions. </b>

<h2>Version update 20.4.2010: What is new in Chipster 1.4.4</h2>

Fixed the 3D scatter plot bug of Chipster 1.4.3  

<hr>

<h2>Version update 9.4.2010: What is new in Chipster 1.4.3</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>New analysis tools</b>
<br>This release completes the miRNA analysis functionality in Chipster and also includes a whole new set of tools for aCGH data. The aCGH functionality, 
kindly contributed by Ilari Scheinin (University of Helsinki) also allows to integrate aCGH data with expression data.
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="annotate-mirna-targets.html">Annotation / Find miRNA targets</a>: Fetches the predicted gene targets for a list of miRNA identifiers in miRanda, miRBase, miRtarget2, PicTar, TarBase and TargetScan.
	<li> <a href="http://chipster.csc.fi/manual/up-down-analysis-mirna.html">Statistics / Up-down analysis of miRNA targets</a>: Given a miRNA expression dataset and a mRNA expression dataset for a two-group comparison experiment, this tool identifies the genes whose expression is down-regulated 
	  in response to an up-regulated miRNA, or vice-versa. </li>  
	<li> aCGH tools: This category is labelled as beta testing because there might still be some changes to the tool names and the manual pages are not yet available. To read 
	more please see recent course <a href="http://chipster.csc.fi/manual/aCGH_slides.pdf">slides</a>. The <a href="http://www.cangem.org/">CanGEM</a> database is used for data import, and probe position and cytoband information. Note that for analyzing your own aCGH data, you can
normalize it with the Normalize / cDNA tool and then fetch the probe positions from CanGEM to allow the subsequent analysis. The following tools are available:
	<ul>
	<li> Import from CanGEM
	<li> Call copy number aberrations from aCGH data
	<li> Plot copy number profiles from called aCGH data
	<li> Identify common regions from called aCGH data
	<li> Test for DNA copy number induced differential expression
	<li> Plot combined profiles of copy number and expression
	<li> Plot copy-number-induced gene expression
	<li> Fetch probe positions from CanGEM
	<li> Add cytogenetic bands
	<li> Count overlapping CNVs: Compares the found CNVs to the <a href=http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/">Database of Genomic variants</a>
	<li> Sample size calculations with an adapted BH method
		</ul>
	<li> <a href="filter-by-column-value">Preprocessing / Filter using a column value</a>: Filters the data based on values in the specified column. This can be used for filtering e.g. by fold change after statistical testing: Selecting "outside"
	  and a cutoff of 1 would give all the genes that are two fold up- or down-regulated (as the FC column is in log2 scale).
	<li> <a href="filter-by-column-term">Preprocessing / Filter using a column term</a>: Filters data based on terms in a specified text column. This can be used for example for retrieving
	  genes belonging to a certain pathway or gene ontology category after running the "Add annotations to data" tool.
	 <li> <a href="norm-prenormalized-affy.html">Normalize / Process prenormalized Affy</a>: Converts normalized Affymetrix data to Chipster format and creates a phenodata table for it.
	 <li><a href="intersect-lists.html">Utilities / Intersect lists</a>: Identifies the intersection, or union, between two or three data tables that share one or more columns with common identifiers.
	</ul>
	
<li><b>Changes to analysis tools</b>
	<ul>
	 <li>  Normalization / Agilent: Flags can be handled in normalization and subsequently used in analysis.
	  <li> Utilities / Search by gene name: Option to include or exclude the specified genes.
	  <li> Utilities / Sort samples: Gene symbols and descriptions are kept in the result file.
	  <li> Utilities / Combine probes to genes: Gene symbols and descriptions are kept in the result file.
	</ul>
<li><b>Changes to visualizations</b>
	<ul>
	  <li> Venn diagram: Possibility to combine datasets using the gene symbol column, instead of the identifier column. This allows you to intersect gene lists from different array platforms</li>
      <li> 3D scatter for PCA: Possibility to color genes according to cluster, p-value, fold change etc.</li>
      <li> Volcano plot: The y-axis -log(p) has been changed to use log10 instead of ln.

	  <li> Clustering / KNN classification: Improved validation of classifiers with a test set.
	</ul>
<li><b>Changes to visualizations</b>
	<ul>
      <li> Hierarchical clustering: Color scheme has been changed to blue-red in order to cater for color blind users. If you prefer the old
      green-red scheme, please note that the colors can be easily changed by right-clicking on the heatmap and 
      selecting Properties /Plot / Heatmap coloring.</li>
      <li> Possibility to add gene / protein annotations to visualizations. If you are analyzing custom chip or proteomics data, Chipster cannot automatically generate
      the gene symbols displayed in visualizations. However, you can now mark any column as annotation in the Import tool, and these annotations will be diplayed together with identifiers
      in the interactive visualizations.</li>

<h2>Version update 27.3.2009: What is new in Chipster 1.2.4</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>New analysis tools</b>
	<ul>
      <li> Statistics/ Ordination-ca: Performs a detrended correspondence analysis. This ordination method can be used for example in quality control and time series analysis. 
      <li> Clustering/ Classification: Adds many new classification methods to Chipster, including variaties of discriminant analysis, neural nets, support vector machines and naive Bayes. The tool does not yet implement validation using a separate test set, only cross-validation.
      <li> Annotation/ miRNA target annotation: Provides miRBase IDs and target predictions (by TargetScan and MIRANDA) for probes from Agilent miRNA arrays. 
      <li> Annotation/ Add annotations to the data: Provides the same annotations (chromosome location, pathway involment etc) as the Annotate gene list -tool, but the annotation columns are appended to the expression data file.
	<li> Normalization/ Normalize to specific genes: Normalizes the data to specific genes given in a separate gene identifier list. The identifier list must have a title row with text "identifier" and contain gene identifiers used in the data file. An average of these genes is calculated, and the expression values of all genes are adjusted using this average.
      <li> Normalization/ Process prenormalized: Allows an easy import of data which has been normalized by some other software. This tool converts the data to Chipster format (by adding the text "chip." in front of the expression value columns) and generates the phenodata file. The normalized data file needs to be imported to Chipster using the Import tool.
      <li> Pathways/ Hypergeometric test for cytobands: Performs a hypergeometric test for enrichment of genes to certain chromosomal positions (cytobands).
      <li> Utilities/ Sort genes: Sorts genes based on a specified column. (As before, you can also sort genes in the spreadsheet view of the visualization panel by clicking on the column names. However, as the visualization panel only shows max 20 000 rows at the time, it is not able to sort larger data sets).
      <li> Utilities/ Extract genes: Extracts the specified number of genes from the top of the data table. For example, one can first run the Calculate descriptive statistics -tool, sort genes based on the standard deviation column, and then extract the 50 top-most genes.
	</ul>
<li><b>Support for new chip types</b>
	<ul>
      <li> Illumina Human HT-12 (when importing these files to Chipster with the Import tool, select the PROBE_ID column as an identifier)
      <li> (Agilent miRNA arrays, see the annotation tool described above)
	</ul>
<li><b>Solved problems</b>
	<ul>
      <li>In some institutions Chipster started normally but no tools could be used (empty error message). This was caused by a proxy server restricting network traffic. This problem has now been solved by a proxy bypass feature.
      <li>Venn diagram didn't allow creating new datasets if one of the files contained only gene identifiers (and no expression columns). This has now been fixed, allowing users to filter datasets with their own gene lists. The column containing the identifiers has to be named "identifier".
	</ul>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Version update 5.2.2009: What is new in Chipster 1.2.3</h2>
<ol>
<li>Chipster is updated automatically also when you start it using the desktop icon (but we still recommend you to launch it from the web page, as this way you can read the latest announcements as well)
<li>Normalization/ Affymetrix exon arrays: Updated the script to use Bioconductor 2.2 in order to overcome the affyio bug. 
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Version update 8.1.2009: What is new in Chipster 1.2.2</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>New analysis tools</b>
	<ul>
      <li> Statistics/ Adjust P-values: Adjusts raw p-values in the selected column for multiple testing using a specified method.
	<li> Normalization/ Normalize to specific samples: Normalizes data to specific samples. The samples to be normalized are coded with 1 in one column of the phenodata. The samples to be normalized to are coded with 0 in the same column.
      <li> Normalization/ Illumina SNP arrays: Illumina SNP array preprocessing. Input should be a tab-delimited text file with genotype calls. Typically such a file is created using GenCall software from Illumina.
      <li> Statistics/ Association analysis: Association tests for normalized SNP array data. Runs a Chi square test for every SNP. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is tested in controls only. Association tests use the grouping information of sample in group column of phenodata. Association tests are run for genotype frequences and dominant and recessive models.
      <li> Utilities/ Combine probes to genes: Calculates an average for probes or probesets for each gene in the dataset. The data file has to have a symbol column for this to work correctly. After running this tool, only expression values and gene symbols are retained in the data, all other columns and information are lost.
	</ul>
<li><b>Changes to analysis tools</b>
	<ul>
      <li>Preprocessing/ Filter by CV: The genes whose CV is bigger than the median CV are kept.
      <li>Normalization/ Illumina: The normalization method parameter has been renamed to "normalize.chips".
      <li>Normalization/ Illumina -lumi pipeline: The normalization method parameter has been renamed to "normalize.chips".
      <li>Promoter analysis/ Weeder: Filtering added so that if there are several probe sets for the same transcript (RefSeq id), the promoter sequence is used only once.
      <li>Promoter analysis/ Cosmo: Filtering added so that if there are several probe sets for the same transcript (RefSeq id), the promoter sequence is used only once.
      <li>Promoter analysis/ ClusterBuster: Filtering added so that if there are several probe sets for the same transcript (RefSeq id), the promoter sequence is used only once.

      <li>Interactive volcano plot
	</ul>
<li><b>Changes to analysis tools</b>
	<ul>
      <li>Statistics/ Linear modelling: More descriptive parameter names. Phenodata column names
are added to the result files for clarity. P-values and fold changes are given also as separate files, so that
they can be used for box plots, clustering, etc.
      <li>Statistics/ NMDS: The sample names are colored according to the group column from the
phenodata. An additional result file is created where the sample names are taken from the description column of the phenodata (defaults to original file names, can be renamed in Chipster).
      <li>Statistics/ One sample tests: By default the chips are scaled to the same mean before running the test, but this can be avoided by the setting the new parameter scale.to.same.mean to "no".
      <li>Utilities/ Calculate descriptive statistics: Writes the descriptives also in a
separate file, which can be used for drawing histograms and boxplots.
      <li>Preprocessing/ Filter by expression: By default the chips are scaled to the same mean before filtering, but this can be avoided by the setting the new parameter scale.to.same.mean to "no".
<li>Normalization/ Agilent 1-color: The normalization method parameter has been renamed to "normalize.chips".

<a name="tools"><h3>New analysis tools</h3></a>

<ul>
<li><b>ROTS</b> (reproducibility-optimized test statistic) ranks genes in order of evidence for differential expression for two-group comparisons. This tool was kindly contributed by Dr Laura Elo (please cite Elo L, Fil�n S, Lahesmaa R and Aittokallio T. 2008 IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics  5: 423-431). <a href="stat-ROTS.html">Read more...</a>   
<li><b>SAFE</b> is a tool for analysis of over- or under-representation of genes in KEGG pathways. It takes both over-representation and expression into account, and the user can define the minimum pathway size to be considered. <a href="pathways-hypergeometric-safe.html">Read more...</a>     
<li><b>lumi pipeline</b> normalization for Illumina data. Lumi offers new normalization methods such as rsn and loess. It uses BeadSummaryData files as input, so your raw data must be in one file. The filename must end with ".txt", and you should NOT use the Import tool for bringing the data into Chipster (in the Import files -window change the action to "Import directly"). <a href="norm-illumina-lumi.html">Read more...</a> 
<li><b>Delete columns</b> enables deletion of unwanted columns from the data, for example after using the Merge tables -tool. <a href="delete-columns.html">Read more...</a> 
<li><b>Random sampling</b> enables random sampling of genes or chips from the data, for example before hierarchical clustering of large datasets.
</ul>

<a name="visualizations"><h3>Visualization news</h3></a>

<b> </b>

<ul>
      <li><b>Possibility to create gene lists by selecting datapoints from images</b>. You can create new gene lists by selecting data points in 2D and 3D scatter plots, Venn diagram and spreadsheet. After selecting data points with the mouse, go to the Selected-tab and click on the "Create dataset" button (for spreadsheets highlight the gene identifiers, right click, and choose "Create dataset").
	<li><b>Interactive Venn diagram</b>. If you select 2-3 datasets (by keeping the control key down) you can visualize them as an interactive Venn diagram and thus create new datasets based on the image.
      <li><b>Data points selected in one visualization stay selected in the next one</b>. Selecting data points for example in a scatter plot will also highlight the same genes in a subsequent spreadsheet view and vice versa.
	<li><b>Possibility to open visualizations in a separate window</b>. Clicking the "Detach" button will open your current visualization in a separate window. This allows you to have several visualizations open at the same time.
	<li><b>Possibility to change sample names in visualizations</b>. The phenodata file has a new column called Description. This column is used for sample names in hierarchical clustering and expression profile visualizations. By default it contains the original chip names, but you can type in any description you like.
      <li><b>Gene symbols are automatically available in 2D scatter plot, SOM visualization and spreadsheets</b>. During normalization both gene symbol and description is added to the spreadsheet. 
	<li><b>Expression profiles are colored according to the expression level</b>
	<li><b>Annotations for data points selected in images is more comprehensive and not limited to Affymetrix data</b>. The Annotate button in the Selected-tab of 2D/3D scatter plots and Venn diagram now creates a gene list of the selected data points and annotates it using Chipster's annotation tool, which is based on Bioconductor (instead of launching the GeneCruiser service by Broad Institute). 
	</ul>

<a name="#chips"><h3>Support for new array types</h3></a>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array</b>. Chipster's Affymetrix normalization and quality control scripts have been changed to use R2.7.1 in order to allow these functionalities also for Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
	<li><b>Agilent drosophila</b>
	<li><b>Agilent rhesus monkey</b>
	<li><b>Note that even if your array is not listed in <a href="supported-chips.html">supported chip types</a>, you can still analyze it with Chipster</b>. For other Illumina and Agilent arrays (such as miRNA arrays) simply choose "empty" as a chiptype during normalization, and Chipster will automatically calculate a mean of all probes which have the same identifier. The only exception is Affymetrix chips, because they require the CDF and probe packages for the summarization to work.
	</ul>

<a name="sessions"><h3>Possibility to save multiple analysis sessions (workspaces)</h3></a>

In order to continue your work later on, you have to save your analysis session (workspace). Saving the session will save all the datasets and their
relationships. In Chipster 1.2, a session is packed into a single compressed file with an extension .cs (for Chipster Session). This file is saved on your computer, but you can also take it with and continue your work on another computer by copying the session file there. Session files also allow you to share your work with a colleague. Chipster 1.2 allows you to save multiple analysis sessions separately, and you can save the session files anywhere you like.</p>

<p>To save a session select File->Save session. A previously saved session can be loaded by selecting File->Open session. By default the current
data is cleared before another session is loaded, but you can also combine sessions by selecting "Add to current session" from the session file dialog.</p>

<p><b>Note!</b> Sessions are an extended version of the previous workspace system.
If you have saved a workspace with an earlier Chipster version, you can open it
by selecting File->Open workspace (session) saved with Chipster 1.1. Unlike
the old workspace system, the new session system also allows you to create
workflows from datasets that were loaded from a session and you
can view all the details for them (including the source
code) in the analysis history.</p>

<a name="workflows"><h3>More flexible analysis workflow saving</h3></a>

<p>Workflows allow you to automate your analysis steps, and also share analysis pipelines with collaborators. Workflow is a description of the analysis steps that you've run to the currently selected dataset. If you have run a workflow that you would like to reuse or perhaps share with a colleague, you should save it by selecting its starting point data set and choosing Workflow->Save starting from selected. In Chipster 1.2 you can save the workflow file anywhere you like. You can also change its name, but the ending has to be .bsh.</p>
<p>You can apply the same workflow to another normalized dataset by selecting Workflow->Open and run, or Workflow->Run recent (if you saved the workflow during the same analysis session or if it is located under nami-workfiles in the chipster-scripts -folder).</p>
