	<h2>Version update 24.1.2012: What is new in Chipster 2.0</h2>

	<p>Chipster 2.0 contains a comprehensive collection of analysis tools for next generation
	sequencing (NGS) data. Visualization options now include a built-in genome browser, allowing you to
	view reads and results in their genomic context. Importantly, also the analysis session handling
	has been improved.</p>

	<ul>

		<li><div class=header-item>NGS functionality</div>.
			<p>
				The following analysis packages and several R-based tools are now available under the NGS tab in
				the Analysis tool panel. For more information about the individual tools, please see the <a
					href="tools-ngs.html">NGS tool manual</a>.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Quality control</b>: FastQC and FASTX.
				<li><b>Utilities and genomic region matching</b>: BEDTools and SAMtools.
				<li><b>Alignment</b>: Bowtie, BWA and TopHat.
				<li><b>RNA-seq</b>: edgeR, Cufflinks, HTSeq.
				<li><b>miRNA-seq</b>: edgeR, pathway analysis for target genes, correlate with target
					expression.
				<li><b>ChIP-seq</b>: MACS, motif detection and matching against JASPAR, retrieval of nearby
					genes and pathway analysis for them.
				<li><b>CNA-seq</b>: Count and plot copy number profile, compare to reference.
				<li><b>MeDIP-seq</b>: MEDIPS.
			</ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>Built-in genome browser</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Allows you to view reads and results in their genomic context using Ensembl

			</ul>
			<p></p>
		<li><div class=header-item>Improved analysis session handling</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Analysis sessions are automatically saved on the background, so if your session stops
					unexpectedly, you can always retrieve your data from the server.
				<li>Analysis sessions use a new format so that saved sessions are functional even if the
					analysis tools that were used for creating them have changed meanwhile. The new sessions have
					ending .zip. <b>The old sessions (.cs) won't work in Chipster 2.0</b>, but we will keep the
					Chipster version 1.4.7 running so that people can access also their old sessions. Note that
					Chipster 2.0 RC was the release candidate version of Chipster 2.0, so those sessions are
					compatible. <b>We strongly encourage all users to move to Chipster 2.0 now, and use
						Chipster 1.4.7 only when working with old .cs sessions. </b>

	<ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>New analysis tools</div> <br>This release completes the miRNA
			analysis functionality in Chipster and also includes a whole new set of tools for aCGH data. The
			aCGH functionality, kindly contributed by Ilari Scheinin (University of Helsinki) also allows to
			integrate aCGH data with expression data.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="annotate-mirna-targets.html">Annotation / Find miRNA targets</a>: Fetches the
					predicted gene targets for a list of miRNA identifiers in miRanda, miRBase, miRtarget2, PicTar,

						Up-down analysis of miRNA targets</a>: Given a miRNA expression dataset and a mRNA expression
					dataset for a two-group comparison experiment, this tool identifies the genes whose expression
					is down-regulated in response to an up-regulated miRNA, or vice-versa.</li>
				<li>aCGH tools: This category is labelled as beta testing because there might still be some
					changes to the tool names and the manual pages are not yet available. To read more please see
					recent course <a href="http://chipster.csc.fi/manual/aCGH_slides.pdf">slides</a>. The <a
					href="http://www.cangem.org/">CanGEM</a> database is used for data import, and probe position
					and cytoband information. Note that for analyzing your own aCGH data, you can normalize it with
					the Normalize / cDNA tool and then fetch the probe positions from CanGEM to allow the
					subsequent analysis. The following tools are available:
					<ul>
						<li>Import from CanGEM

						<li>Sample size calculations with an adapted BH method
					</ul>
				<li><a href="filter-by-column-value">Preprocessing / Filter using a column value</a>:
					Filters the data based on values in the specified column. This can be used for filtering e.g.
					by fold change after statistical testing: Selecting "outside" and a cutoff of 1 would give all
					the genes that are two fold up- or down-regulated (as the FC column is in log2 scale).
				<li><a href="filter-by-column-term">Preprocessing / Filter using a column term</a>: Filters

	<ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>New analysis tools</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Statistics/ Ordination-ca: Performs a detrended correspondence analysis. This
					ordination method can be used for example in quality control and time series analysis.
				<li>Clustering/ Classification: Adds many new classification methods to Chipster, including
					variaties of discriminant analysis, neural nets, support vector machines and naive Bayes. The
					tool does not yet implement validation using a separate test set, only cross-validation.
				<li>Annotation/ miRNA target annotation: Provides miRBase IDs and target predictions (by
					TargetScan and MIRANDA) for probes from Agilent miRNA arrays.
				<li>Annotation/ Add annotations to the data: Provides the same annotations (chromosome
					location, pathway involment etc) as the Annotate gene list -tool, but the annotation columns
					are appended to the expression data file.
				<li>Normalization/ Normalize to specific genes: Normalizes the data to specific genes given
					in a separate gene identifier list. The identifier list must have a title row with text
					"identifier" and contain gene identifiers used in the data file. An average of these genes is
					calculated, and the expression values of all genes are adjusted using this average.
				<li>Normalization/ Process prenormalized: Allows an easy import of data which has been
					normalized by some other software. This tool converts the data to Chipster format (by adding
					the text "chip." in front of the expression value columns) and generates the phenodata file.
					The normalized data file needs to be imported to Chipster using the Import tool.
				<li>Pathways/ Hypergeometric test for cytobands: Performs a hypergeometric test for
					enrichment of genes to certain chromosomal positions (cytobands).
				<li>Utilities/ Sort genes: Sorts genes based on a specified column. (As before, you can
					also sort genes in the spreadsheet view of the visualization panel by clicking on the column
					names. However, as the visualization panel only shows max 20 000 rows at the time, it is not
					able to sort larger data sets).
				<li>Utilities/ Extract genes: Extracts the specified number of genes from the top of the
					data table. For example, one can first run the Calculate descriptive statistics -tool, sort
					genes based on the standard deviation column, and then extract the 50 top-most genes.
			</ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>Support for new chip types</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Illumina Human HT-12 (when importing these files to Chipster with the Import tool,
					select the PROBE_ID column as an identifier)
				<li>(Agilent miRNA arrays, see the annotation tool described above)
			</ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>Solved problems</div>
			<ul>
				<li>In some institutions Chipster started normally but no tools could be used (empty error
					message). This was caused by a proxy server restricting network traffic. This problem has now
					been solved by a proxy bypass feature.
				<li>Venn diagram didn't allow creating new datasets if one of the files contained only gene
					identifiers (and no expression columns). This has now been fixed, allowing users to filter
					datasets with their own gene lists. The column containing the identifiers has to be named
					"identifier".

				<li>Statistics/ Adjust P-values: Adjusts raw p-values in the selected column for multiple
					testing using a specified method.
				<li>Normalization/ Normalize to specific samples: Normalizes data to specific samples. The
					samples to be normalized are coded with 1 in one column of the phenodata. The samples to be
					normalized to are coded with 0 in the same column.
				<li>Normalization/ Illumina SNP arrays: Illumina SNP array preprocessing. Input should be a
					tab-delimited text file with genotype calls. Typically such a file is created using GenCall
					software from Illumina.
				<li>Statistics/ Association analysis: Association tests for normalized SNP array data. Runs
					a Chi square test for every SNP. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is tested in controls only.
					Association tests use the grouping information of sample in group column of phenodata.

		<li><div class=header-item>New functionality and visualization:</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Interactive volcano plot
			</ul>
		<li><div class=header-item>Changes to analysis tools</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Statistics/ Linear modelling: More descriptive parameter names. Phenodata column names
					are added to the result files for clarity. P-values and fold changes are given also as separate
					files, so that they can be used for box plots, clustering, etc.
				<li>Statistics/ NMDS: The sample names are colored according to the group column from the

	<h3>New analysis tools</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><b>ROTS</b> (reproducibility-optimized test statistic) ranks genes in order of evidence
			for differential expression for two-group comparisons. This tool was kindly contributed by Dr
			Laura Elo (please cite Elo L, Fil�n S, Lahesmaa R and Aittokallio T. 2008 IEEE/ACM Transactions
			on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 5: 423-431). <a href="stat-ROTS.html">Read
				more...</a>
		<li><b>SAFE</b> is a tool for analysis of over- or under-representation of genes in KEGG
			pathways. It takes both over-representation and expression into account, and the user can define
			the minimum pathway size to be considered. <a href="pathways-hypergeometric-safe.html">Read
				more...</a>
		<li><b>lumi pipeline</b> normalization for Illumina data. Lumi offers new normalization
			methods such as rsn and loess. It uses BeadSummaryData files as input, so your raw data must be
			in one file. The filename must end with ".txt", and you should NOT use the Import tool for
			bringing the data into Chipster (in the Import files -window change the action to "Import
			directly"). <a href="norm-illumina-lumi.html">Read more...</a>
		<li><b>Delete columns</b> enables deletion of unwanted columns from the data, for example
			after using the Merge tables -tool. <a href="delete-columns.html">Read more...</a>
		<li><b>Random sampling</b> enables random sampling of genes or chips from the data, for
			example before hierarchical clustering of large datasets.
	</ul>


	<h3>Visualization news</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Possibility to create gene lists by selecting datapoints from images</b>. You can
			create new gene lists by selecting data points in 2D and 3D scatter plots, Venn diagram and
			spreadsheet. After selecting data points with the mouse, go to the Selected-tab and click on the
			"Create dataset" button (for spreadsheets highlight the gene identifiers, right click, and choose
			"Create dataset").
		<li><b>Interactive Venn diagram</b>. If you select 2-3 datasets (by keeping the control key
			down) you can visualize them as an interactive Venn diagram and thus create new datasets based on
			the image.
		<li><b>Data points selected in one visualization stay selected in the next one</b>. Selecting
			data points for example in a scatter plot will also highlight the same genes in a subsequent
			spreadsheet view and vice versa.
		<li><b>Possibility to open visualizations in a separate window</b>. Clicking the "Detach"
			button will open your current visualization in a separate window. This allows you to have several
			visualizations open at the same time.
		<li><b>Possibility to change sample names in visualizations</b>. The phenodata file has a new
			column called Description. This column is used for sample names in hierarchical clustering and
			expression profile visualizations. By default it contains the original chip names, but you can
			type in any description you like.
		<li><b>Gene symbols are automatically available in 2D scatter plot, SOM visualization and
				spreadsheets</b>. During normalization both gene symbol and description is added to the spreadsheet.














		
		<li><b>Expression profiles are colored according to the expression level</b>
		<li><b>Annotations for data points selected in images is more comprehensive and not
				limited to Affymetrix data</b>. The Annotate button in the Selected-tab of 2D/3D scatter plots and
			Venn diagram now creates a gene list of the selected data points and annotates it using
			Chipster's annotation tool, which is based on Bioconductor (instead of launching the GeneCruiser
			service by Broad Institute).
	</ul>

	<h3>Support for new array types</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array</b>. Chipster's Affymetrix normalization and quality
			control scripts have been changed to use R2.7.1 in order to allow these functionalities also for
			Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
		<li><b>Agilent drosophila</b>
		<li><b>Agilent rhesus monkey</b>
		<li><b>Note that even if your array is not listed in <a href="supported-chips.html">supported
					chip types</a>, you can still analyze it with Chipster
		</b>. For other Illumina and Agilent arrays (such as miRNA arrays) simply choose "empty" as a chiptype
			during normalization, and Chipster will automatically calculate a mean of all probes which have
			the same identifier. The only exception is Affymetrix chips, because they require the CDF and
			probe packages for the summarization to work.
	</ul>

	<h3>Possibility to save multiple analysis sessions (workspaces)</h3>
	<p>In order to continue your work later on, you have to save your analysis session (workspace).
		Saving the session will save all the datasets and their relationships. In Chipster 1.2, a session
		is packed into a single compressed file with an extension .cs (for Chipster Session). This file is
		saved on your computer, but you can also take it with and continue your work on another computer
		by copying the session file there. Session files also allow you to share your work with a
		colleague. Chipster 1.2 allows you to save multiple analysis sessions separately, and you can save
		the session files anywhere you like.</p>

	<p>To save a session select File-&gt;Save session. A previously saved session can be loaded by
		selecting File-&gt;Open session. By default the current data is cleared before another session is
		loaded, but you can also combine sessions by selecting "Add to current session" from the session
		file dialog.</p>

	<p>
		<b>Note!</b> Sessions are an extended version of the previous workspace system. If you have saved
		a workspace with an earlier Chipster version, you can open it by selecting File-&gt;Open workspace
		(session) saved with Chipster 1.1. Unlike the old workspace system, the new session system also
		allows you to create workflows from datasets that were loaded from a session and you can view all
		the details for them (including the source code) in the analysis history.
	</p>

	<h3>More flexible analysis workflow saving</h3>

	<p>Workflows allow you to automate your analysis steps, and also share analysis pipelines with
		collaborators. Workflow is a description of the analysis steps that you've run to the currently
		selected dataset. If you have run a workflow that you would like to reuse or perhaps share with a
		colleague, you should save it by selecting its starting point data set and choosing
		Workflow-&gt;Save starting from selected. In Chipster 1.2 you can save the workflow file anywhere
		you like. You can also change its name, but the ending has to be .bsh.</p>
	<p>You can apply the same workflow to another normalized dataset by selecting Workflow-&gt;Open
		and run, or Workflow-&gt;Run recent (if you saved the workflow during the same analysis session or
		if it is located under nami-workfiles in the chipster-scripts -folder).</p>

	<h3>General improvements</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Improved Workflow view: automatic sizing, better layout</b>
		<li><b>The limit of concurrent analysis jobs per user is increased from 5 to 10 </b>
	</ul>
