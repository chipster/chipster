<h2>Threshold dotplot of two sequences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool uses Emboss program <b>dotmatcher</b> to generate a dotplot from two input sequences. 
The dotplot is an intuitive graphical representation of the regions of similarity between two sequences. All positions from the first input sequence are
   compared with all positions from the second input sequence using a specified substitution matrix. The two sequences are the axes of the
   rectangular dotplot. Wherever there is "similarity" between a position
   from each sequence a dot is plotted. The threshold conditions for
   "similarity" are defined by the user.
</p>
<p>
   All positions from the first input sequence are compared with all
   positions from the second input sequence and scored, using the
   specified substitution matrix. This produces a matrix of scores from
   which local regions of similarity (corresponding to diagonals in the
   dotplot) are identified. A window of user-specified length is moved
   along all possible diagonals. Each position in the window corresponds
   to a pair-wise score from the scoring matrix. The score for the entire
   window is the sum of the scores for individual positions within it. If
   the window score is above the user-defined threshold, then a line is
   plotted on the dotplot corresponding to the window.

<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
