<h2>Utilities / Predict primers/adaptors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Tool to predict primer/adaptor sequences.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Input type (FASTQ, FASTA) [FASTQ]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Tool will attempt to predict the tag (i.e. primer/adapter) at either or both sites, if possible. The algorithm implemented 
for the tag prediction assumes the randomness of a typical metagenome. Datasets that do not contain 
random sequences from organisms in an environment, but rather contain, for example, 16S data may 
cause incorrect detection of the tag sequences. However, the tag sequences will most likely be 
over-predicted and can be redefined by the user prior to data processing. The tag sequence prediction 
uses filtered base frequencies instead of raw base frequencies. This allows a more accurate prediction 
as it accounts for incomplete and shifted tag sequences. If no tags are reported, then no tags could 
be identified in the data set. 
</p>
<p>
Input can be a FASTQ file or a FASTA file.
</p>
<p>
No trimming will be performed.

<h3>Output</h3>

The output is a tab-delimited text file.
