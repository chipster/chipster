<h2>A5 assembly pipeline for microbial genomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Construct small genomes based on the Illumina MiSeq data.</p>


<p>This tool runs A5-miseq pipeline that is designed for assembling DNA 
sequence data generated on the Illumina sequencing platform. There are many 
situations where A5-miseq is not the right tool for the job. In order to 
produce accurate results, A5-miseq requires Illumina data with certain characteristics. 
A5-miseq will likely not work well with Illumina reads shorter than around 80nt, or reads 
where the base qualities are low in all or most reads before 60nt. A5-miseq 
assumes it is assembling homozygous haploid genomes. Use a different 
assembler for metagenomes and heterozygous diploid or polyploid organisms. 
Use a different assembler if a tool like FastQC reports your data quality is 
dubious. 
</p>
<p>
The tool needs a pair of fastq formatted paired-end reads files.
