<h2>Normalization / Batch effects (sva) </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes batch effect from the data using Combat algorithm.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Phenodata column for main batch effect</li>
<li>Phenodata column for additional batch effects</li>
<li>Phenodata column for additional batch effects</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool removes random (batch) effects, e.g. where samples cluster according to preparation day/laboratory 
instead of the biological group under study, using methodology described in Johnson et al. 2007. The method, 
called ComBat, uses either parametric or non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch
effects. In order to use this tool, you need to add new phenodata column(s) where you indicate the random effect
with numbers (e.g. 1 = laboratory one, 2 = laboratory two, 3 = laboratory three, etc). Please note that this 
kind of random effects modelling is recommended only when each random effect groups contains multiple arrays.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tab-delimited text file containing gene names, expression estimates that has been corrected for batch effects
and call values ("flags").  This file is suitable for all further analyses.</p>
