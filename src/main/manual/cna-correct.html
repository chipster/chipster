	<h2>CNA-seq / Correct for GC content</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Takes the counts per bin for a CNA-seq data set and corrects them for GC content.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Degree of smoothing (...) [0.65]</li>
		<li>Distribution family to use (gaussian, symmetric) [symmetric]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Correcting for GC content is necessary because it affects enzyme chemistry and therefore also the depth of sequencing coverage. The correction is performed by rounding the GC contents of each bin to integer values, calculating the median read count for each GC content, and fitting a loess curve to the data.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The input data set with raw counts replaced by GC corrected ones.</p>
	
	<h3>References</h3>
