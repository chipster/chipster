	<h2>CNA-seq / Correct for GC content</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Takes the counts per bin for a CNA-seq data set and corrects them for GC content and mappability.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Method (ratio, median, none) [ratio]</li>
		<li>Degree of smoothing (...) [0.65]</li>
		<li>Distribution family to use (gaussian, symmetric) [symmetric]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Correcting for GC content is necessary because it affects enzyme chemistry and therefore also the depth of sequencing coverage. Mappability represents the uniqueness of sequences in the genome and also needs to be corrected for.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The input data set with raw counts replaced by corrected ones. The data is also log2-transformed.</p>
