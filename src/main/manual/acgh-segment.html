	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Segment copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Segments copy number data.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Minimum number of features per segment (2, 3, 4, 5) [2]</li>
		<li>Minimum number of SDs between segments [0.0]</li>
		<li>Significance level (...) [0.01]</li>
		<li>Re-normalize (yes, no) [yes]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Log ratios are segmented using DNAcopy. Segments are consecutive areas that most likely share the same copy number and are separated by breakpoints. Optionally, a re-normalization can be performed with CGHcall. This recursively searches for the interval containing the most segmented data, decreasing the interval length in each recursion. The recursive search makes the post-segmentation normalization robust against local maxima. This function is particularly useful for profiles for which, after segmentation, the 0-level does not coincide with many segments. It is more or less harmless to other profiles.</p>
	<p>The input data must contain these columns: chromosome, start, end.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The inputted log ratios are accompanied with segmented log ratios.</p>
