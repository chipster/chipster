<h2>MEDIPS - methylation analysis, treatment only</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This tool performs methylation analysis of sequencing data for a single file or a set of files if they are derived from a single condition, e.g., if all files are from a control experiment or a single treatment. Currently, the tool works only with human data.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Species (human) [human] </li>
<li>Use only promoters (yes, no) [no] </li>
<li>Resolution for coverage calculation (25,50,100,200) [50] </li>
<li>Smoothing extension (200,400,800,1200) [400] </li>
<li>Fragment length (400,800,1600,2400) [800] </li>
<li>Save a BED file (yes, no) [yes] </li>
<li>Promoter lenght, upstream from the TSS (1000, 2000, 5000) [1000] </li>
<li>Promoter length, downstream from the TSS (250,500,750,1000) [500] </li>
<li>Image width (200...3200) [600] </li>
<li>Image height (200...3200) [600] </li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Based on the input data, a genome-wide coverage is calculated. The resolution for the coverage calculation can be set, and it is by default 50 bps. 
Smoothing of the resolution is recommended, and can be set separately from the coverage resolution. The default length
 for smoothing is 400 bp. Normalization is controlled using the setting for fragment length. 
 Users can choose to calculate the enrichment of methylated CpG islands for promoter regions only, and select the length of the promoter region used. 
 The default is 1000 bps upstream and 500 bps downstream from the transcription start site.</p>

<p>During the analysis, the whole genome or just the promoter regions are split into bins of coverage resolution (by default 50 bps). 
The short read coverage is calculated using this resolution. Since the short reads are not the whole length sonicated DNA fragments, 
smoothing of the results is usually performed by extending the reads. During the extension, each read is extended to both telomeric and sentromeric 
directions by the amount set in the smoothing extension parameter. For normalization the local CpG density needs to be estimated. 
The setting for fragment length specifies the area around each genomic bin that is used for calculating the local CpG density. 
The fragment length should be set close to the estimated size of the sonicated DNA fragments generated after the amplification.</p>

Several quality control plots are generated: 
<ul>
<li>The saturation analysis plot is used for deciding whether the amount of data is enough to cover the genome and generate reliable and reproducible methylation profiles.</li>
<li>The coverage analysis plot is used for getting an idea of number of CpGs covered by the short reads, and the depth of the coverage.</li>
<li>The calibration curve plot enables examination of the dependency of local CpG densities and signals derived from the data.</li>
</ul>

The following histograms of the final results are generated:
<ul>
<li>The CpG densities plot features a histogram of the local CpG densities.</li>
<li>The RPM signal plot displays a histogram of the number of reads per million of the reads per a genomic bin.</li>
<li>The AMS signal plot displays a histogram of absolute methylation scores (a measure normalized by the number of genomic bins covering a certain region of interest in the genome).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Methylation results are given in the file methylation.tsv. Users can also choose to have the relative methylation scores in a BED file, which can be visualized in the Chipster genome browser.
Several plots are generated as described above.
