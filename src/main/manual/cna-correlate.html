	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Plot correlations of called copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This tool calculates the correlations of copy number aberrations between different regions the the genome and plots them.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Human genome build to use (GRCh37/hg19, NCBI36/hg18, NCBI35/hg17, NCBI34/hg16) [GRCh37/hg19]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Plotting the correlations can help to identify specific aberrations that often co-occur. Two gains that co-occur will have a positive correlation coefficient (plotted in blue), whereas a gain and a loss that co-occur will have a negative correlation coefficient (red).</p>
	
	<p>This tool should be run after running the Identify common regions from called copy number data tool.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>Two plots of the correlation matrix, one showing each region with the same size, and another showing each region according to their true genomic size. Also a numberic table of the correlation coefficients is produced.</p>
