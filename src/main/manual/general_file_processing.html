<h2>Modify text</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool reads a text file and performs the selected operation for it.
Note that the search string is interpreted as regular expression where: 
<ul>
<li>dot (.) is interpreted as "any single character". For example <i>a.a</i> would match for example <i>aba</i>, <i>aca</i> but not <i>abba</i>.</li>
<li>plus (+) is interpreted as "one or more of the proceeding characters". For example <i>a+b</i> would match for example <i>ab</i>, <i>aab</i> and <i>caaab</i>.</li>
<li>asterisk (*) is interpreted as "zero or more of the proceeding characters". For example <i>cA*b</i> would match for example <i>cb</i> and <i>cAAb</i> but not <i>cDb</i>.</li>
</ul>

Further, because of security issues, several non-alphabet characters are not allowed in string definitions. 
These include:
",#,[,],{,},%,$,&,|,>,&gt , ?
