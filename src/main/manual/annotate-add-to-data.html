<h2>Annotation / Add annotations to the data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool appends annotations to the expression data for the selected Affymetrix, Illumina or Agilent gene list.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

Use conditional GO term annotation (yes/no) [no]

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, Affymetrix probe set IDs, Illumina Target IDs and Agilent probe names can be annotated. 
Note that if a gene is annotated with several terms of the same branch in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy, 
(e.g. Regulation of cell death / Regulation of programmed cell death / Regulation of apoptotic process), 
this tool will list by deafult only the most specific term and ignore the parent terms. 
You can get all the terms by setting the Conditional parameter to yes.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This tool writes a data file where annotation columns are appended to the gene expression value columns. Annotations contain chromosome location, pathway information, and links to databases such as Pubmed and RefSeq.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>This tool utilizes the Bioconductor package
