<h2>Statistics / Linear modelling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistical testing using linear modelling and user-defined design matrices.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Contrasts []</li>
<li>Technical replication [EMPTY]</li>
<li>p-value adjustment method (none, Bonferroni, Holm, Hochberg, BH, BY) [BH]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This linear modelling tool is based on the Bioconductor package limma. Statistical testing can be done either using a
limma-kind of design matrix alone (if designed to account for coefficients), or using the design matrix and contrasts stating which 
coefficients are to be estimated. NOTE: As input you need to select both the expression value file and the design matrix file by holding down the Control key in the "Datasets" or "Workflow" panel.
</p>

<p>In order to use this tool, you need to create a design matrix of the experiment with rows corresponding to samples and 
columns corresponding to coefficients/sample classes to be estimated. For example, the matrix below shows that arrays from 1 to 4 belong to GroupA 
and arrays from 5 to 8 to GroupB, etc. In addition, it states that arrays #1, #5 and #9 as well as arrays #2, #6 and #10, etc form 
blocks, i.e. were from the same individual. Please note that when defining blocks, the design matrix should contain one block-group
less than there are real groups. For more help about the how to make a design matrix, please consult the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma user-manual</a>.

<p>The contrast parameter constructs a contrast matrix corresponding to the specified contrasts of a set of parameters. For example, if your
design matrix includes four groups (GroupA, GroupB, GroupC and GroupD), you may use the contrast parameter to restrict statistical testing to 
only include comparisons between GroupA and GroupB as well as between GroupC and GroupD. This is done by setting the parameter to 
GroupA-GroupB,GroupC-GroupD. Please note that levels defined here must match the coefficients/sample-classes given in the design matrix.
</p>

<p>The parameter technical replication allows you to specify which samples are technical replicates (the same RNA hybridized on different chips), 
and it is treated in a special way in the linear models (using a mixed model). Information indicating which samples are technical replicates is
read from the given phenodata column </p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Three tab-delimited text files are output as a result of the analysis. The "p.values.tsv" table lists the p-values for tested contrasts, the factor 
level being reflected in the column headers. For example, a column labeled "chip.p.adjusted.X-Y.tsv" refers to the comparison of level X to level Y. 
The "foldchange.tsv" table holds the corresponding fold changes. Fold change values are essentially the log2 of the ratio between the averaged expression
values of samples for the first factor level and the second factor level. The "limma.tsv" table combines the p-values and fold changes results, together 
with the expression values and annotation information for the probes tested, in a convenient summary table that is suitable for further processing or 
analysis.</p>
