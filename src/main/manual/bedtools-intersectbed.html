<h2>Matching genomic regions / Intersect BED</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Report overlaps between two feature files.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>File A is BAM format (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write uncompressed BAM output (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write output as BED (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original entry in A for each overlap (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original entry in B for each overlap (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original A and B entries (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original A and B entries (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original A entry once if any overlaps found in B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Only report those entries in A that have no overlaps with B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A (0.0-1.0) [0.000000001}</li> 
<li>Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A and B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Force strandedness (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Treat split BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals (yes, no) [no]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
By far, the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features is whether or not any of the
features in the two sets “overlap” with one another. This is known as feature intersection. intersectBed
allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features. Moreover, it allows one to have
fine control as to how the intersections are reported. intersectBed works with both BED/GFF/VCF
and BAM files as input.
</p>
<p>
Selecting "File A is BAM format [yes]" is analogous to using "-abam" option instead of "-a" in the command line version.

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output is a tab-delimited text file.
