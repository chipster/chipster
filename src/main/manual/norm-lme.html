<h2>Normalization / Random effects (LME) </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes batch effect from the data.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Phenodata column for group effects</li>
<li>Phenodata column for random effects</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool removes random (batch) effects, e.g. where samples cluster according to preparation day instead of 
the biological group under study, using a linear mixed modelling approach. In order to use this tool, 
you need to add a new phenodata column where you indicate the random effect with numbers (e.g. 1 = hybridization day
 for the first batch, 2 = hybridization day for the second batch, etc). Please note that this kind of random effects modelling
  is recommended only when you have at least four different values in your random effect column.  </p>

<p>One linear mixed-effect model is fit to every gene, and the residuals of the models are returned.
These residuals are the corrected expression values that can then be further analysed as usual. At the moment, only random intercept is allowed for random effects.</p>
<!-- A full random slope and
intercept model implementation is currently under work.-->

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tab-delimited text file containing gene names, expression estimates and call values ("flags"). 
This file is suitable for all further analyses.</p>
