	<h2>CNA-seq / Filter copy number bins</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This tool takes as input a table on binned read counts (from Define CNA-seq experiment), and filters out bins that are known to behave spuriously.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>QDNAseq blacklist (remove, keep) [remove]</li>
		<li>ENCODE blacklist (remove, keep) [remove]</li>
		<li>minimum mappability (0-100) [0]</li>
		<li>sex chromosomes (remove, keep) [remove]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>By default, bins in the QDNAseq or ENCODE blacklists are filtered out, as are the sex chromosomes. A minimum mappability can also be specified.</p>
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>Data table with the chosen bins filtered out.</p>
