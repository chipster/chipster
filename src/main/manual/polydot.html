<h2> Draw dotplots for all-against-all comparison of a sequence set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool uses Emboss program <b>ploydot</b> to generate a 
   dotplot for each of an all-against-all comparison
   of a set of sequences. The dotplots are rendered on a single diagram. 
   The dotplot is an intuitive graphical representation of the regions of
   similarity between two sequences. All positions from the first input
   sequence are compared with all positions from the second input sequence
   searching for exact matches between sequence regions ("words"). The two
   sequences are the axes of the rectangular dotplot. Wherever there is
   "similarity" between a word from each sequences a dot is plotted. The
   wordsize is specified by the user. Optionally, information on the
   sequence and location of all the exact matching regions may be written
   to file as a feature file.
   </p><p>
  All sequence words of the specified size from the first input sequence
   are compared with all words from the second input sequence and exact
   matches identified. A line is plotted on the dotplot corresponding to
   any exact matching words. Thus any local regions of identity correspond
   to diagonals in the dotplot.
</p>


<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
Note that this tool reads just one input file, that should contain all the sequences to be analyzed.
