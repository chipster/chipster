	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Fuse regions by column value</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Fuses together consecutive regions based on column values, e.g. those with a significant p-value.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>column (...) [pvalue]</li>
		<li>is (smaller than, smaller than or equal to, equal to, larger than or equal to, larger than, not equal to, within, outside) [smaller than]
		<li>cutoff [0.05]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>This tool fuses together consecutive regions that match a user-specified criteria. This can be handy when doing a statistical test between groups or for survival and obtaining a number of consecutive regions with a significant pvalue. This tool allows these consecutive regions to be combined into one, and statistical tests then repeated yielding new p-values for the larger region.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to the table of regions, this tool also needs as an input file the original data file with the original features where the regions where derived from.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>A table with new chromosomal regions. The number of data points in each region is also returned.</p>
	<p>A PDF containing two plots: 1) frequencies of losses (red) and gains (blue), and 2) a plot showing each chromosome as a horizontal line, with each breakpoint bumping the vertical position of the line. On top of this black line, frequencies of losses/gains are shown in red/green.</p>
