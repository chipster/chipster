	<h2>aCGH / Test for copy number induced expression changes</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Nonparametric testing for changes in expression induced by a change in DNA copy number. 
	The copy number and expression probes of the two data sets must be matched together beforehand using the 
	tool "Match copy number and expression probes".</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Test statistic to use (wcvm, wmw) [wcvm]</li>
		<li>Type of analysis (univariate, regional) [univariate]</li>
		<li>Number of permutations (...) [10000]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Performs a permutation-based non-parametric test to detect genes whose expression has been changed through a change in DNA copy number. 
	Please see the referenced article for details on the two possible test statistics (weighted Cramer-Von Mises or weighted Mann-Whitney), 
	and whether the test statistic should be &quot;shrunken&quot; within a region (regional), or not (univariate). 
	Note that running this tool can take some hours depending on the size of the dataset.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>A table of matched copy number and expression data, along with p-values of the permutation test. This file can be used to plot expression profiles of individual genes (&quot;Plot copy-number-induced gene expression&quot; tool).</p>
