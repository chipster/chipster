	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Fuse regions manually</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Fuses together consecutive regions overlapping a user-specified area in the genome.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>position</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>This tool fuses together consecutive regions that overlap a user-specified area in the genome. This can be handy when regions from tool Identify common regions from called copy number data contains artifacts splitting what are believed to be true individual regions into multiple ones.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to the table of regions, this tool also needs as an input file the original data file with the original features where the regions where derived from.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>A table with new chromosomal regions. The number of data points in each region is also returned.</p>
	<p>A PDF containing two plots: 1) frequencies of losses (red) and gains (blue), and 2) a plot showing each chromosome as a horizontal line, with each breakpoint bumping the vertical position of the line. On top of this black line, frequencies of losses/gains are shown in red/green.</p>
