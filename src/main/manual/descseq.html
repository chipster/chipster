<h2>Extract regions from a sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract regions from a sequence.
 
</p>


<p>This tool uses EMBOSS command <b>extractseq</b> to read a sequence and write 
sub-sequences from it to file. The set of regions to extract is specified  
as pairs of start and end positions. The regions are written in  the order 
in which they are specified. Thus, if the sequence AAAGGGTTT has been input 
and the regions: 7-9, 3-4 have been specified, then the
   output sequence will be: TTTAG. Optionally, each region may be written
   out as a separate sequence.
</p>
<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
</p>
<p>
For more details, please check the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/extractseq.html">manual page of extractseq command</a>.
