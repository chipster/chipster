<h2>Replace or delete sequence section</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool is based on EMBOSS command <b>bioseq</b>.
This tool searches for a target subsequence in one or more input sequences 
and replaces matching region with an insert subsequence, or optionally, just deletes 
the target subsequence where found. 

If the target subsequence occurs more than once, then each 
instance of the target is replaced or deleted.
</p>
<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
</p>
<p>
For more details, please check the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/biosed.html">manual page of biosed command</a>.
