<h2>Restrict</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool reports restriction enzyme cleavage sites in a nucleotide sequence.
</p>


<p>
The cleavage sites are determined with EMBOSS command <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/restrict.html">restrict</a> that 
 scans one or more nucleotide sequences for cut sites for a supplied set of restriction enzymes. One or more restriction enzymes
   can be specified or alternatively all the enzymes in the REBASE
   database can be investigated. The minimum length of a recognition site
   to be reported must be specified. The output file shows the
   location of the cut sites. There are several options to control exactly
   what sites are reported and the format of the output file. Optionally,
   the fragment lengths of the forward sense strand produced by complete
   restriction by each restriction enzyme on its own, or by using all of
   the input enzymes together, may be reported. Results are added to the
   tail section of the report.
</p>
<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
</p>
