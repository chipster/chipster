<h2>Metagenomics / Align sequences with Mothur</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given a fasta file of 16S rRNA sequences, aligns them to the Silva 16S rRNA template sequence set.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

None

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Sequences in are aligned, one by one, against the Silva 16S rRNA reference set. Kmer searching with 8mers is followed by Needleman-Wunsch 
pairwise alignment, which penalizes the same amount for opening and extending a gap.
<p>
<p>
The alignment result is given in fasta format, with periods ('.') leading up to the first base in the sequence and following the last base of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
This tool is based on the <a href="http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Align.seqs">Align.seqs</a> command of the Mothur package.
</p>


</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>aligned.fasta: Aligned sequences </li> 
<li>aligned-summary.tsv: Summary statistics for the aligned sequences </li> 
</ul>
</p>
