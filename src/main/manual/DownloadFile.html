<h2>Utilities / Download file from URL directly to server</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Download a file from a URL address to the Chipster server. The URL must be visible to Chipster server. If it's not, use client's 'Import from URL to client' functionality instead.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li>URL. URL to download</li> 
<li>Add a file extension. The output file is named according to the last part of the URL. If it doesn't contain a correct file extension, select it here so that the file type is recognized correctly.</li> 
<li>Require valid SSL certificate. Disable if the https server has a self-signed ssl certificate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Some file sharing services may use random URLs. This is a problem for file type checks, that rely on the file extensions. Please set the parameter "Add a file extension" in case the URL doesn't contain the correct file extension.   
</p>

<p>
When downloading files with https protocol, the server must have a valid certificate to prove its identity. By default Java accepts all the certificates issued by most common certificate authorities (CA). The parameter "Require valid SSL certificate" can be used to disable this check in case you are downloading from the server without a proper certificate and you trust the network between your machine and the server. 
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output file is named according to the last part of the URL.
