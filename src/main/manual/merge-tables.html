<h2>Merge tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Combines two tables using the first column.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>Include all the rows in the result file (yes, no)[no]</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Two tables are combined using the identifiers in the first column. All the columns of the second file are added after the columns of the first file.
By default only those rows which have the same identifier are combined. 
However, you can choose to include also those rows, which are present in only one of the files.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tab-delimited table containing all the rows that can be combined from the two tables.
Note that as the result file contains all the columns from both tables, you need to delete duplicate fields
before for further analysis. This can be done using the tool Utilities / Delete columns.</p>
