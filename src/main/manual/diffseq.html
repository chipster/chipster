<h2>Compare two similar sequences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool uses EMBOSS command <b>diffseq</b> to compare two nearly similar sequences. 
This tools finds regions of overlap between the two sequences and
reports on differences between the features of the two sequences within
these regions. The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. The start
and end positions of the regions of overlap are reported. Any differences between 
the sequences, and any features (except the source feature) that overlap those differences, 
are included in the output report.

The differences are also reported for each input sequence as two separate feature table output files.
</p>
<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
</p>
