<h2>Retrieve reads from SRA database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This tool retrieves reads in FASTQ format from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">SRA database</a> based on the SRR ID of a dataset.
The data retrieval and processing is done with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?view=toolkit_doc">SRA Toolkit<a> package.
</p><p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
As the SRA archive files can be very large, downloading the data can take a long time.
</p><p>
Sample entry names:
<pre>
SRR412821
ERR431372
</pre>
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The reads of the defined SRA experiment are stored in FASTQ format. In the case of paired-end data, the
reads are stored in two FASTQ files.

By default all the reads of the experiment are retrieved but you can choose to retrieve of just those reads that 
aligned with the reference genome, or only those that did not align with the reference genome.</p>
