<h2>BWA MEM for single or paired end reads and own genome</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool aligns single end reads or paired-end reads to the reference genome sequence given by the user.  
The reads have to be supplied in fastq format. If two input files is selected, one of the file is used as a reference genome and the another one
is used as the reads file for single-end alignment.
If three input files are defined, then paired end analysis is performed.
</p>

<h3>Alignment parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Minimum seed length</b> Matches shorter than this will be missed 
when looking for maximal exact matches or MEMs in the first alignment phase.(BWA MEM option -k)</li>
<li><b>Maximum gap length</b> Gaps longer than this will not be found. Note also that scoring matrix and hit 
length affect the maximum gap length, in addition to this band width parameter.(BWA MEM option -w)</li>
<li><b>Match score</b> Score for a matching base.(BWA MEM option -A)</li>
<li><b>Mismatch penalty</b> Penalty for a mismatching base (BWA MEM option -B).</li>
<li><b>Gap opening penalty</b> Gap opening penalty (BWA MEM option -O).</li>
<li><b>Gap extension penalty</b> Gap extension penaltyÂ (BWA MEM option -E).</li>
<li><b>Penalty for end clipping</b> Penalty for 5'- and 3'-end clipping. When performing the Smith-Waterman 
extension of the seed alignments, BWA-MEM keeps track of the best score reaching the end of the read. 
If this score is larger than the best SW score minus the clipping penalty, clipping will not be applied (BWA MEM option -L).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Read group parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Read group identifier</b> If you want to add the read group line into the BAM file, 
 you have to define read group identifier (DI:<i>value</i>).</li>
<li><b>Sample name for read group</b> The name of the sample sequenced in this read group (SM:<i>value</i>).</li>
<li><b>Platform for read group</b> With this setting you can platform or technology used to produce 
the read. Options: ILLUMINA, SOLID, LS454, HELICOS, PACBIO.(PT:<i>value</i>)</li>
<li><b>Library identifier for read group</b> DNA preparation library identifier. The Mark Duplicates 
tool uses this field to determine which read groups might contain molecular duplicates, in case the 
same DNA library was sequenced on multiple lanes.(LB:<i>value</i>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>As a result the tool returns a sorted and indexed BAM-formatted alignment, which is ready for viewing in the Chipster genome browser.</p>
