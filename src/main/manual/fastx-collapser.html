<h2>Utilities / Remove duplicates from FASTQ or FASTA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a FASTQ or a FASTA file, this tool removes identical sequences.
</p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>

none

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Identical sequences are collapsed into a single sequence. 
The sequences are renamed with two numbers: a running number followed by how many times that sequence occurred.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A FASTQ or FASTA file containing unique reads
 (note that even if the input file was FASTA, the result file will have the ending ".fastq", so you have to rename it to ".fasta"). </p>

<h3>Reference</h3>

This tool is based on the FASTA/Q Collapser tool of the <a href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">FASTX package</a>.
