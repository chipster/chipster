<h2>Remap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
 Displays restriction enzyme binding sites in a nucleotide sequence.
</p>


<p>
The cleavage sites are determined with EMBOSS command <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.5/emboss/apps/restrict.html">remap</a> 
that scans one or more nucleotide sequences for recognition sites
   and/or cut sites for a supplied set of restriction enzymes. One or more
   restriction enzymes can be specified or alternatively all the enzymes
   in the REBASE database can be investigated. The minimum length of a
   recognition site to be reported must be specified. It writes an output
   file showing the location of the cut sites and (optionally) the
   recognition sites. Sites on both strands are shown by default but there
   are many options to control exactly what sites are reported and the
   format of the output file. Optionally, the translated sequence is
   reported. Additionally, the output file lists enzymes that cut / do
   not cut the sequence and which match / do not matching certain
   specified criteria.
</p>
<p>
The input sequences can be in any of the <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">EMBOSS compatible sequence formats</a>.
