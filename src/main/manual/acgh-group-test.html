	<h2>Copy number aberrations / Group tests for called copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Statistical tests between two or more groups for called copy number data. The testing is recommended to be performed after running the Identify common regions from called aCGH data tool.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Phenodata column separating the samples into two or more groups</li>
		<li>Test statistic (Chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis) [Chi-square]</li>
		<li>Number of permutations (...) [10000]</li>
		<li>Aberrations to test (losses, gains, both) [both]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Perform statistical testing between groups for differences in copy number aberrations. Three different test statistics are available for the p-value calculations. The significance of the p-values is evaluated by permuting the sample groups, and a false discovery rate is calculated. At least 10,000 permutations are recommended for final calculations, and this will require a significant amount of time. Testing can be performed only for gains/losses, or both.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The input table appended with loss/gain/amplification frequencies for the different groups, along with p-values and false discovery rates.</p>
	<p>A plot showing frequencies of gains (blue) and/or losses (red) together with the -log10 tranformed false discovery rate (FDR, right scale).</p>
