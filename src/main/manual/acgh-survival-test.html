	<h2>aCGH / Survival test for called copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Statistical tests for survival and called aCGH data. The testing is recommended to be performed after running the Identify common regions from called aCGH data tool.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Phenodata column with survival data</li>
		<li>Phenodata column with survival status (1=dead, 0=alive)</li>
		<li>Number of permutations (...) [10000]</li>
		<li>Aberrations to test (losses, gains, both) [both]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>Perform the logrank test for survival with called copy number data. The significance of the p-values is evaluated through permutations, and a false discovery rate is calculated. At least 10,000 permutations are recommended for final calculations, and this will require a significant amount of time. Testing can be performed only for gains/losses, or both.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The input table appended with with p-values and false discovery rates.</p>
