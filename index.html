<h2><a name="downloads" class="anchor"></span></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>Chipster is a server based system that integrates a large amount of backend analysis tools and databases. The recommended installation method is to download prepackaged virtual machine images that contain all the required components and are ready to run.</p>

<p>For virtual machine based installation, the Ubuntu based images are available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/molbio/chipster/dist/virtual_machines/">virtual machine downloads (KVM, VMware and VirtualBox)</a></p>

<p>For manual installation, the Chipster server packages are available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/molbio/chipster/dist/versions/">server downloads (Linux 32/64 x86 and Mac OS X)</a></p>

<p>The package for manual install contains all the components of the system, including the client application. It also contains installation scripts to set up your environment and configure all the components. Backend analysis tools and databases need to be installed separately.</p>
