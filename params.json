{"name":"Chipster","tagline":"Open source platform for data analysis","body":"Chipster is a versatile data analysis platform with an intuitive graphical user interface. It currently contains a comprehensive collection of analysis tools for microarray and NGS data. The Chipster platform has also been used for sequence analysis.\r\n\r\nChipster platform is a distributed system with various backend services and an intuitive graphical client that has been developed in a usability oriented manner. Different analysis tools can be plugged in, while support for R/Bioconductor integration is emphasised. The whole system is written with Java. See longer description for more information.\r\n\r\nChipster has been originally developed by CSC- IT Center for Science. A running Chipster system is available at our Chipster at CSC site.\r\n\r\nChipster is licensed under GPL version 3 or later. See license.txt inside the source code repository for details.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nChipster is a server based system that integrates a large amount of backend analysis tools and databases. The recommended installation method is to download prepackaged virtual machine images that contain all the required components and are ready to run.\r\n\r\nFor virtual machine based installation, the Ubuntu based images are available at:\r\n\r\n[virtual machine downloads (KVM, VMware and VirtualBox)](http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/molbio/chipster/dist/virtual_machines/)\r\n\r\nFor manual installation, the Chipster server packages are available at:\r\n\r\n[server downloads (Linux 32/64 x86 and Mac OS X)](http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/molbio/chipster/dist/versions/)\r\n\r\nThe package for manual install contains all the components of the system, including the client application. It also contains installation scripts to set up your environment and configure all the components. Backend analysis tools and databases need to be installed separately.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions for both the virtual machine and manual installation options are in wiki.\r\n\r\nSee [release notes](http://chipster.sourceforge.net/release_notes.shtml) for information on different Chipster versions.\r\n\r\n## Contact information\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or ideas regarding Chipster, please join us at Chipster mailing lists. We want to encourage people to use mailing lists instead of contacting developers directly, as often answers and discussions are useful to many other users also.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
